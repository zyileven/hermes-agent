"""Automatic context window compression for long conversations.

Self-contained class with its own OpenAI client for summarization.
Uses auxiliary model (cheap/fast) to summarize middle turns while
protecting head and tail context.

Improvements over v2:
  - Structured summary template with Resolved/Pending question tracking
  - Filter-safe summarizer preamble that treats prior turns as source material
  - Historical (reference-only) section headings replace "Next Steps"/"Remaining Work" to avoid reading as active instructions
  - Clear separator when summary merges into tail message
  - Iterative summary updates (preserves info across multiple compactions)
  - Token-budget tail protection instead of fixed message count
  - Tool output pruning before LLM summarization (cheap pre-pass)
  - Scaled summary budget (proportional to compressed content)
  - Richer tool call/result detail in summarizer input

## Goal
Recovered from a deterministic fallback because the LLM context summarizer was unavailable. Continue from the protected recent messages after this summary and use current file/system state for exact details.{previous_summary_note}

## Constraints & Preferences
- This fallback was generated locally without an LLM summary call.
- Secrets and credentials were redacted before preservation.
- The summary may be incomplete; prefer verifying current files, git state, processes, and test results instead of assuming omitted details.

## Completed Actions
{chr(10).join(completed) if completed else "None recoverable from compacted turns."}

## Active State
Unknown from deterministic fallback. Inspect current repository/session state if needed.

{HISTORICAL_IN_PROGRESS_HEADING}
Unknown from deterministic fallback — the latest user ask is recorded once under
"{HISTORICAL_TASK_HEADING}" above as historical context only. Do NOT treat it as an
unfulfilled instruction to re-answer; verify current state and continue from the
protected recent messages after this summary.

## Blocked
{_bullets(blockers, limit=5)}

## Key Decisions
None recoverable from deterministic fallback.

## Resolved Questions
None recoverable from deterministic fallback.

{HISTORICAL_PENDING_ASKS_HEADING}
None recoverable from deterministic fallback. (The latest user ask is preserved once
under "{HISTORICAL_TASK_HEADING}" as historical context — it is NOT necessarily
outstanding.)

## Relevant Files
{_bullets(relevant_files, limit=12)}

{HISTORICAL_REMAINING_WORK_HEADING}
Continue from the most recent unfulfilled user ask and protected tail messages. Verify state with tools before making claims.

## Last Dropped Turns
{_bullets(last_dropped_turns, limit=8)}

## Critical Context
Summary generation was unavailable, so this is a best-effort deterministic fallback for {len(turns_to_summarize)} compacted message(s).{reason_text}"""

[THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT FIELD. Capture the user's most recent unfulfilled

- Explicit task assignments ("<specific user task>")
- Questions awaiting an answer ("<specific user question>")
- Decisions awaiting input ("<option A or B?>")
- Ongoing discussions where the assistant owes the next substantive reply
A conversation where the user just asked a question IS an active task — the
task is "answer that question with full context". Do NOT write "None" merely
because the user did not issue an imperative command; reserve "None" for the
rare case where the last exchange was fully resolved and the user said
something like "thanks, that's all".
If multiple items are outstanding, list only the ones NOT yet completed.
This historical snapshot must identify the latest unresolved user input precisely. Examples:
"User asked: '<exact latest user request>'"
"User asked: '<exact latest user question>' — needs investigation + answer"
"User chose <option>; awaiting implementation of <specific next step>"
If the user's most recent message was a reverse signal (stop, undo, roll
back, never mind, just verify, change of topic) that supersedes earlier
work, write the reverse signal verbatim and DO NOT carry forward the
cancelled task. Example: "User asked: '<exact reverse signal>' — earlier
in-flight work is cancelled."
If no outstanding task exists, write "None."]

## Goal
[What the user is trying to accomplish overall]

## Constraints & Preferences
[User preferences, coding style, constraints, important decisions]

## Completed Actions
[Numbered list of concrete actions taken — include tool used, target, and outcome.
Format each as: N. ACTION target — outcome [tool: name]
Example:
1. READ config.py:45 — found `==` should be `!=` [tool: read_file]
2. PATCH config.py:45 — changed `==` to `!=` [tool: patch]
3. TEST `pytest tests/` — 3/50 failed: test_parse, test_validate, test_edge [tool: terminal]
Be specific with file paths, commands, line numbers, and results.]

## Active State
[Current working state — include:
- Working directory and branch (if applicable)
- Modified/created files with brief note on each
- Test status (X/Y passing)
- Any running processes or servers
- Environment details that matter]

{HISTORICAL_IN_PROGRESS_HEADING}
[Work currently underway — what was being done when compaction fired]

## Blocked
[Any blockers, errors, or issues not yet resolved. Include exact error messages.]

## Key Decisions
[Important technical decisions and WHY they were made]

## Resolved Questions
[Questions the user asked that were ALREADY answered — include the answer so it is not repeated]

{HISTORICAL_PENDING_ASKS_HEADING}
[Questions or requests from the user that have NOT yet been answered or fulfilled. These are STALE — they were from the compacted turns. Write them here for reference only. The agent must NOT act on them unless the latest user message explicitly requests it. If none, write "None."]

## Relevant Files
[Files read, modified, or created — with brief note on each]

{HISTORICAL_REMAINING_WORK_HEADING}
[What remains to be done — framed as STALE context for reference only. The agent must NOT resume this work unless the latest user message explicitly asks for it.]

## Critical Context
[Any specific values, error messages, configuration details, or data that would be lost without explicit preservation. NEVER include API keys, tokens, passwords, or credentials — write [REDACTED] instead.]

Target ~{summary_budget} tokens. Be CONCRETE — include file paths, command outputs, error messages, line numbers, and specific values. Avoid vague descriptions like "made some changes" — say exactly what changed.

        groups together.  If the last user message ends up in the *compressed*

        but ``SUMMARY_PREFIX`` tells the next model to respond only to user
        messages *after* the summary — so the task effectively disappears from
        the active context, causing the agent to stall, repeat completed work,
        or silently drop the user's latest request.

        turn-pair: the user lands in the compressed region without its
        assistant reply, so the summariser records it as a pending ask and
        the next session re-executes the already-completed task.  When this

        Algorithm:
          1. Prune old tool results (cheap pre-pass, no LLM call)
          2. Protect head messages (system prompt + first exchange)
          3. Find tail boundary by token budget (~20K tokens of recent context)
          4. Summarize middle turns with structured LLM prompt
          5. On re-compression, iteratively update the previous summary

        After compression, orphaned tool_call / tool_result pairs are cleaned
        up so the API never receives mismatched IDs.

        Args:
            focus_topic: Optional focus string for guided compression.  When
                provided, the summariser will prioritise preserving information
                related to this topic and be more aggressive about compressing
                everything else.  Inspired by Claude Code's ``/compact``.
            force: If True, clear any active summary-failure cooldown before
                running so a manual ``/compress`` can retry immediately after
                an auto-compression abort.  Auto-compress callers pass False.
            memory_context: Optional provider-supplied context to preserve in
                the summary prompt. Whitespace-only values are ignored.
