"""Regression: prevent transcript fork when two paths compress the same session_id.

Damien's incident (Discord, 2026-05-28): a long Hermes session in a Discord
gateway hit the compression threshold at the end of a turn.  The parent agent
finished delivering the response and ``conversation_loop.py`` fired
``_spawn_background_review(...)`` — which builds a forked ``AIAgent`` that
inherits ``agent.session_id`` (see ``agent/background_review.py``::
``review_agent.session_id = agent.session_id``).  Roughly two seconds later
a synthetic ``Background process proc_… completed`` event arrived and
started a fresh turn on the same parent ``session_id`` (still cached in the
gateway's ``SessionEntry``).  Both paths hit preflight compression on the
same parent transcript and called ``_compress_context`` concurrently.  Each
ended the parent and created its own CHILD session in ``state.db``, both
parented to the same old id.  The gateway's ``SessionEntry`` only caught one
rotation; the other child became an orphan that silently accumulated writes.

Repro shape on Damien's machine:

  parent 20260527_234659_e65f0e  ended_at=set  end_reason='compression'
  child  20260528_113619_fc80e1  parent=20260527_234659_e65f0e  (in SessionEntry)
  child  <orphan>                parent=20260527_234659_e65f0e  (silent writes)

This regression simulates the two concurrent ``compress_context`` calls
against a shared ``state.db`` and asserts that the per-session compression
lock added in this PR prevents the orphan child.  Without the lock the
fixture deterministically produces 2 children; with the lock, exactly 1.

    The per-session compression lock only serialises a SAME-WINDOW concurrent
    race. It does NOT stop a stale parent from being compressed again in a
    LATER turn: if ``review_agent`` had won the race, its new child session is
    never adopted by the gateway (the fork is single-lifecycle and dies right
    after one ``run_conversation``), so the foreground path would start the
    next turn from the stale parent and compress it AGAIN — leaving the same
    parent with two sibling children.

    The fix makes the review fork never trigger compression at all. Both
    compression trigger sites in ``agent/conversation_loop.py`` gate on
    ``agent.compression_enabled`` BEFORE calling ``_compress_context``:
      • preflight (``if agent.compression_enabled and len(messages) > ...``)

    builds. It calls the real worker synchronously with
