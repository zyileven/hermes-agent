"""Local-environment toolchain probe for the system prompt.

When the terminal backend is local (the agent's tools run on the same
machine as Hermes itself), we surface a single deterministic line about
Python tooling state so models don't have to discover it by hitting
walls.  Common failure modes this addresses:

* Hermes ships under one Python (e.g. 3.11 in a bundled venv) while the
  user's login shell has a different one (e.g. 3.12 system).  ``pip``
  resolved from PATH may not match ``python3 -m pip``.
* The bundled-venv Python has no pip module installed → ``python3 -m
  pip`` returns ``No module named pip``.
* The system Python is PEP-668 externally-managed → naive
  ``pip install`` fails with ``error: externally-managed-environment``.

The probe is cheap (a handful of subprocess calls, ~50ms total),
cached for the lifetime of the process, and emits **at most one
short line** when something non-default is detected.  When the
environment looks normal (python3+pip both present and matched, no
PEP 668), it emits nothing — no token cost.

Remote terminal backends (docker, modal, ssh, …) are skipped: the
host's Python state is irrelevant when tools run inside a sandbox.
The sandbox has its own existing probe (``_probe_remote_backend``)
in ``agent/prompt_builder.py``.

Toggle via ``agent.environment_probe`` in config.yaml (default True).

    Output is captured through temporary files rather than ``capture_output``

    console-script launcher (e.g. ``pip.exe``) can spawn a descendant that

    OS pipes, the reader threads inside ``subprocess.communicate()`` then block

    cover, because killing the direct child leaves the grandchild holding the
    pipe.  A whole warm probe could hang for ~28 min this way while holding
    ``_CACHE_LOCK``, wedging every new session's system-prompt build.

    Temp files have no reader threads, so ``wait()`` only ever waits on the
    direct child; a lingering grandchild holding the handle can't block us, and
    the probe genuinely fails open on timeout.
