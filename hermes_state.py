SQLite State Store for Hermes Agent.

Provides persistent session storage with FTS5 full-text search, replacing
the per-session JSONL file approach. Stores session metadata, full message
history, and model configuration for CLI and gateway sessions.

Key design decisions:
- WAL mode for concurrent readers + one writer (gateway multi-platform)
- FTS5 virtual table for fast text search across all session messages
- Compression-triggered session splitting via parent_session_id chains
- Batch runner and RL trajectories are NOT stored here (separate systems)
- Session source tagging ('cli', 'telegram', 'discord', etc.) for filtering

    """Repair a state.db whose ``sqlite_master`` schema is malformed or whose
    FTS indexes reject writes.

    Handles two corruption classes: the "duplicate object definition" /
    malformed-schema class where even ``PRAGMA`` statements fail, and the FTS
    write-corruption class (#50502) where base tables read fine and
    ``integrity_check`` passes but writes fail through the ``messages_fts*``
    triggers. Tries least-destructive recovery first and escalates:

      1. **Rebuild FTS indexes in place** via the FTS5 ``'rebuild'`` command,
         which rewrites the internal b-tree segments from the canonical
         ``messages`` rows without dropping or recreating anything. Fixes the
         FTS write-corruption class while preserving the schema intact.
      2. **De-duplicate** ``sqlite_master`` (keep the lowest rowid per
         ``type``/``name``). Fixes the canonical "table X already exists"
         case and PRESERVES the existing FTS index intact.
      3. **Drop the FTS schema** (every ``messages_fts*`` object) + ``VACUUM``.
         The next ``SessionDB()`` open rebuilds the FTS indexes from the
         canonical ``messages`` table.

    Canonical ``sessions`` / ``messages`` rows are never modified. A
    timestamped raw backup is taken first unless ``backup=False``.

    # racing on the same session_id and producing orphan child sessions.
    #
    # The race: ``conversation_compression.py`` rotates ``agent.session_id``
    # as a side effect of a successful compression (end old session, create
    # new). That mutation is local to the AIAgent instance — but ``state.db``
    # is shared across all instances. Two AIAgents that share the same
    # ``session_id`` at the moment they both decide to compress (most
    # commonly the parent turn's agent + a background-review fork started
    # right after the turn ended) each end the parent and create their own
    # NEW session, parented to the same old id. The gateway SessionEntry
    # only catches one rotation; the other child silently accumulates
    # writes — Damien's "parent → two orphan children" repro shape.
    #
    # The lock is keyed by ``session_id`` and is held for the duration of
    # the compress() call plus the rotation. ``holder`` identifies the
    # current owner (pid:tid:nonce) for diagnostics; the lock is recovered
    # via ``expires_at`` if the holder process crashed without releasing.

        """List sessions with preview (first user message) and last active timestamp.

        Returns dicts with keys: id, source, model, title, started_at, ended_at,
        message_count, preview (first 60 chars of first user message),
        last_active (timestamp of last message).

        Uses a single query with correlated subqueries instead of N+2 queries.

        By default, child sessions (subagent runs, compression continuations)
        are excluded.  Pass ``include_children=True`` to include them.

        With ``project_compression_tips=True`` (default), sessions that are
        roots of compression chains are projected forward to their latest
        continuation — one logical conversation = one list entry, showing the
        live continuation's id/message_count/title/last_active. This prevents
        compressed continuations from being invisible to users while keeping
        delegate subagents and branches hidden. Pass ``False`` to return the
        raw root rows (useful for admin/debug UIs).

        Pass ``order_by_last_active=True`` to sort by most-recent activity
        instead of original conversation start time. For compression chains,
        the "most-recent activity" is taken from the live tip (not the root),
        so an old conversation that was compressed and continued recently
        surfaces in the correct slot. Ordering is computed at SQL level via
        a recursive CTE that walks compression-continuation edges, so LIMIT
        and OFFSET still apply efficiently.

        ``search_query`` matches case-insensitive substrings against each
        surfaced row's title and id (and, like ``id_query``, every title/id in
        its forward compression chain). A punctuation-stripped variant is also
        matched so e.g. ``an94`` finds ``AN-94``. Only honored in the
        ``order_by_last_active`` path.

        Pass ``compact_rows=True`` for dashboard and picker callers that only
        need lightweight metadata. This omits the ``system_prompt`` blob from
        the SELECT so SQLite never copies it out of the B-tree page — a
        significant I/O saving on large databases where the blob routinely
        runs to tens of kilobytes per row.

          survive an inadvertent parent cleanup.
        * Deletes the rows in a single ``_execute_write`` callback so
          the operation is atomic — a partial failure (e.g. SIGKILL
          mid-loop) doesn't leave the DB in a "messages-deleted but
          session-row-still-there" half-state.
        * Cleans up on-disk transcript files (``.json`` / ``.jsonl`` /
          ``request_dump_*``) outside the DB transaction when
          ``sessions_dir`` is provided. Empty sessions don't typically
          have transcript files, but the gateway can leave a stub
          ``request_dump_*`` if it crashed before the first reply —
